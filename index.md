# Hello and welcome to my website!
My name is Haema Nilakanta (pronounced: "hey-ma" "kneel-uh-kan-ta"). I'm a statistician and currently a Lead AI Scientist at Target Corporation HQ. I completed my PhD in statistics at the [University of Minnesota's School of Statistics](http://www.stat.umn.edu) under [Professor Galin Jones](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~galin/). My dissertation was on: [Output Analysis of Monte Carlo Methods with Applications to Networks and Functional Approximation](https://search.proquest.com/openview/e1a9b4026d25c85cc2b0684037b12cca/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y).

# Research Interests
My research focus is in output analysis of Monte Carlo methods with applications in estimating network properties and approximating functions. I am also more broadly interested in statistical computing methods, measuring reliability in computational methods, and its applications to public health and population sciences. 

I also have interests in demand forecasting, applied Bayesian methodology, and recommender systems.
